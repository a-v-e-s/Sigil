-use fibonacci sequence to choose letters from user's input to choose starting points for the grid?

pixies/points will become extremely small with large height & width values, but do i really need to account for this?
figure out how to inflate the image and smooth the pixels out so that it won't take an immense amount of time to calculate for a 500x500 image, for example.
